# Cartesian Product

In this Problem I'm trying to make a generator function just looklike a "itertools.product" method, that make a cartesian product of the initial argument and yield them.

During my learning process of language theory, there was a question that what is the language of strings with length equal to 3 that the alphabet is {0, 1}, I tryied to solve this problem using python and you can see my solution.

Also the answers of my question was:

```
{000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}
```

You can use solution.py to get the same result.

## TestModule:

In the **Test/** directory there is a test.py file, can contains with some testcases.
Move terminal path to this directory and run:

```python
python3 -m unittest -v test.py
```
