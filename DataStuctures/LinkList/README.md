# LinkList Implementation

In **linklist.cpp** file I have implemented linklist data structure using c++, and the code are so basic and easy to understand because I'm new to C++. 

Also if you run the code, you will have a simple display of an example, so you can change inside the **main()** function to your example and get the result.
