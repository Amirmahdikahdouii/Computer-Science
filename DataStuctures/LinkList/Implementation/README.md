# LinkList Implementation

## Implementation using c++:

In **linklist.cpp** file I have implemented linklist data structure using c++, and the code are so basic and easy to understand because I'm new to C++. 

Also if you run the code, you will have a simple display of an example, so you can change inside the **main()** function to your example and get the result.

## Implementation using Python:

Also in this directory, There is a Python file named: **linklist.py** that has implementation of LinkList in Python.

You can check this by yourself but I will develop a testcase for this module and append more features to this **LinkList** class for better experience.

### Todo:
- [ ] Write Test Cases for **linklist.py**.
- [ ] Append more features into LinkList Object of **linklist.py**
- [ ] Develop and change **linklist.cpp**
