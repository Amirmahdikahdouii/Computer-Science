# Palindrom strings:

We are gonna find out that is a string palindrom or no!

**Palindorm string:** Is a string that is equal with reverse of itself.

Examples:

```
Level
Wow
Heh
```

I'm gonna find out with **Stack** data structure. 
You can run **solution.py** file with and test **is_palindromic()** function.

**Note:** There is a file named **stack.py** that has Implementation of basic stack same as file that stored in **Stack/Implementation/stack.py** But I'm have problem to import this file, when I'm testing from test module. So if you have a solution, It will be my plessure to set issue and solve it!

## Testing:

There is a test file named: **Tests/test_solution.py** that has Testcases for solution.py module.
Move your teminal path into **Tests/** directory and run:

```
python -m unittest -v test_solution.py
```
