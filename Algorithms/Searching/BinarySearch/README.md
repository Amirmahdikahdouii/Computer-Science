# Binary Search:

Binary search is a searching algorithm that is used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. **The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the middle element of the interval with the target value.** If the middle element is equal to the target value, the algorithm returns the index of the middle element, otherwisetarget value is less than the middle element, the algorithm searches the left half of the interval and If the target value is greater than the middle element, the algorithm searches the right half of the interval. 

This process is repeated until the target value is found or the search interval is empty. 

**Time Complexity: O(log n)**
